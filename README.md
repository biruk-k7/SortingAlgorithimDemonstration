## About the Project
This project provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms implemented in Java. By animating the sorting process step-by-step, users can gain a deeper understanding of how each algorithm works. The visualization includes controls to adjust the array size, generate random data, and select different sorting algorithms. This project serves as a valuable educational tool for students and developers who want to learn about sorting algorithms and their efficiency.

To compile and run the program, in the terminal, type:

javac *.java

java InsertionSort; java MergeSort
